Additionally, the analysis aimed to differentiate between Work From Home (WFH) and Work From Office (WFO) percentages.

**Data Source**
The attendance data was provided in an Excel file. It underwent ETL operations to prepare it for detailed analysis.

**Steps :**
-Understanding the Problem:
-Defined the analysis scope, focusing on attendance patterns, retention strategies, and sick leave percentages.
-Data Gathering and Transformation:
-Collected attendance data from the provided Excel file.
-Applied ETL operations to clean and transform the data for analysis.
